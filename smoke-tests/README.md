## Smoke Tests

These tests are designed to be run _after_ the project has successfully been built. They are designed to
ensure that Saffron can successfully load configuration files in various formats with ESM host projects
and CommonJS host projects. These tests can be run via the `test.smoke` package script and are run
automatically in CI.
